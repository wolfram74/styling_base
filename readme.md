This is the base html for an HTML and css mimicry exercise.

Take the agnostic HTML tags in agnostic.html, reassign the elements with standard HTML tags and together with styles.css, try to imitate the visual form of [Berkshire Hathaway's main page](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/)

Alternatively take the divitis.html and reassign those elements with even less guiding hand.

To challenge yourself, use as few classes as possible.
